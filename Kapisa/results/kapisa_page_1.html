	<p><strong> Introduction</strong><br>
  The Socio-Demographic and Economic Survey (SDES) in Kapisa Province was carried out successfully in September 2014 despite the security problem.  This is the fourth batch of provinces, simultaneous with Parwan Province, which undertook SDES after the successful completion of Kabul Province.  This is a continuing project initiated in 2011 in Bamiyan by the Central Statistics Organization (CSO) of Afghanistan and is being rolled out to other provinces with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) providing technical support.<br>This report presents data on the population characteristics, literacy, educational attainment, migration, employment, functional difficulty, fertility, mortality, birth registration and living status of parents disaggregated by sex and district.  Information on the household and housing characteristics is also included.  The findings of the report will aid the local development planners and programme implementers to develop sound evidence-based policies and programs designed for the localities for the effective delivery of basic services to the people of Afghanistan.<br>Security remains a challenge in most areas in the country as in this province.   Two districts namely, Tagab and Alasay were not covered for this reason.  Their population characteristics are not available in the report. Nevertheless, important indicators at the province level could be estimated.<br>To ensure that high quality data are collected in SDES, several layers of supervision and monitoring were done starting from the training of surveyors, survey enumeration to data processing.</p>
